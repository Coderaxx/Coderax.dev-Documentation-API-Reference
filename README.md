# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

## Welcome to the wiki of my Homey Apps and API's!

Welcome to API docs! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with the API's. You can also find detailed guides on how my different apps for Homey Pro work.

## Want to jump right in?

Feeling like an eager beaver? Jump in to the quick start docs and get making your first request:

{% content-ref url="basics/quick-start.md" %}
[quick-start.md](basics/quick-start.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
