# Using the App

***

## **Controlling Your Mill Heaters**

* Thermostat Mode Changes: Trigger actions when the thermostat mode changes.
* Conditions: Check if the thermostat is heating or not, and what mode it's in.
* Actions: Set the thermostat mode to Comfort, Sleep, Away, or Program.

## **Pro Tips**

* For full control with Homey, enable "Control Device Individually" in the Mill app.
* Now supports Energy (requires re-pairing if the device was added before version 1.0.6).

## Privacy and Disclaimer

***

### **Privacy Policy**

* The app uses Sentry.io for logging exceptions and errors. No personal or device information is sent, only error logs.

### **Disclaimer**

* Use the app at your own risk. The app is developed using the same APIs and interfaces as the official Mill app, but there is a chance that API calls can have unexpected consequences.
