# Understanding Mill Drivers

## **Mill Driver vs. Mill v2 Driver**

***

* **Mill Driver**: For room-based control. Devices must not be in “Control Individually” mode and should be assigned to a room in the Mill app. Read more about the v1 driver [here](mill-v1.md).
* **Mill v2 Driver**: For individual device control. Requires devices to be set in “Control Individually” mode. Read more about the v2 driver [here](mill-v2.md).
