# Quick Start

## Get your API keys

~~Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. Any request that doesn't include an API key will return an error.~~

All API usage is currently **FREE** of charge, and does **NOT** require authorization. This will at some point change, and your requests will return a HTTP 401 error if you don't provide an access token.
