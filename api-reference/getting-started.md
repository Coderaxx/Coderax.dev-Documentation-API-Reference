# Getting Started

Welcome to the API documentation! Here's everything you need to know to start using the APIs effectively.

### Get your API keys

~~Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. Any request that doesn't include an API key will return an error.~~

All API usage is currently **FREE** of charge, and does **NOT** require authorization. This will at some point change, and your requests will return a HTTP 401 error if you don't provide an access token.

**GraphQL Playground:** [**https://api.crdx.us/graphql**](https://api.crdx.us/graphql)
{% endhint %}

To get started using my API's, simply navigate to one of the API references in the sidebar and explore sample queries.

You can also test the API's by playing around in the GraphQL playground. Have fun!üòÅ

### Exploring the API Documentation

Each API endpoint is thoroughly documented to help you understand its functionality, parameters, and the structure of responses. Navigate through the API references in the sidebar to find detailed information about each endpoint.

### Sample Queries and Responses

For a hands-on experience, the documentation includes sample queries and their expected responses. These examples will guide you in crafting your own requests and understanding how the API responds to various queries.

### Error Handling and Codes

Understand how the API communicates errors. Familiarize yourself with common error codes like HTTP 401 for unauthorized access, and learn how to handle these errors in your application.

### Rate Limits and Fair Usage Policy

While the API is currently free, it's important to be aware of any rate limits or fair usage policies that might be implemented in the future. This section will provide guidelines on acceptable usage to ensure the API remains responsive and available to all users.

### GraphQL Playground: Interactive API Exploration

The GraphQL Playground at [https://api.crdx.us/graphql](https://api.crdx.us/graphql) is an interactive environment where you can experiment with queries in real-time. Use this tool to test your queries and see immediate responses, helping you to understand the API's capabilities and behavior.

### Feedback and Support

Your feedback is crucial for the continuous improvement of the API. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, this section will guide you on how to reach out for support or provide feedback.

### Staying Updated

APIs evolve over time. This section will inform you about how to stay updated with the latest changes, new features, or deprecations in the API. Subscribe to a mailing list or follow a change log to ensure you're always using the latest version of the API.
